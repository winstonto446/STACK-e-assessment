# STACK e-Assessment Project

This repository contains code snippets for my final-year mathematics project "STACK it up: Automated Assessment in Higher Mathematics" at Durham University.

## Overview
My final year project is interdisciplinary, combining mathematics, computing and education. I built automated assessment tools in STACK using Maxima CAS, JavaScript (JSXGraph), and HTML/LaTeX. I programmed dynamic randomisation (variables randomisation, question variants), partial scoring, and interactive visualisations and tools (in JSXGraph) to enhance assessments in higher mathematics, focusing on the third year maths module Mathematical Biology. I also implemented custom feedback and error-handling, answer validations to improve user experience and reliability. Some of these are demonstrated in the code snippets in this repository.
